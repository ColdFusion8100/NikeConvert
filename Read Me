NikeConvert

NikeConvert is a command-line application designed to automate the reformatting of data exported from a Nike Triax Elite exercise watch. The exported data typically includes information about laps, workout details, and sample data.


Features
Data Transformation: NikeConvert takes the exported text file as input and transforms it into a more structured and usable format.
Flexible Output: You can choose to export the transformed data as a single combined CSV file or as individual CSV files for laps, workout details, and sample data.

Running the Application
Open a command prompt or terminal.
Navigate to the directory containing the NikeConvert.exe file.

Command Syntax:
NikeConvert.exe <inputFilePath> <outputPath> [-s]
<inputFilePath>: Path to the exported text file from the Nike Triax Elite watch.
<outputPath>: Directory where the transformed CSV files will be saved.

[-s]: (Optional) Save the transformed data as a single combined CSV file.

Examples:

NikeConvert.exe "C:\path\to\exportedData.txt" "C:\path\to\outputDirectory"

To transform data and save as a single combined CSV file:
NikeConvert.exe "C:\path\to\exportedData.txt" "C:\path\to\outputDirectory" -s
